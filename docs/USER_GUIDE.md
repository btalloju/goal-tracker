## Working with Milestones

Milestones break goals into manageable steps.

### Why Use Milestones?

Breaking large goals into smaller milestones:
- Makes progress visible and measurable
- Reduces overwhelm
- Provides regular wins to stay motivated
- Helps identify blockers early

### Creating a Milestone

2. Click **+ Add Milestone**
3. Enter:
   - **Title** - The specific task
   - **Due Date** - When it should be done
   - **Notes** - Additional context (optional)
4. Click **Add**

### Example: Goal with Milestones

**Goal:** Run a 5K Marathon

| Milestone | Due Date | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Buy running shoes | Jan 10 | ✓ Completed |
| Run 1K without stopping | Jan 20 | ✓ Completed |
| Run 2K without stopping | Jan 30 | ○ Pending |
| Run 3K without stopping | Feb 10 | ○ Pending |
| Run 5K (race day!) | Feb 20 | ○ Pending |

### Completing Milestones

1. Click the checkbox next to a milestone
2. The milestone is marked as completed
3. Completion date is recorded automatically

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small

Begin with 2-3 categories and 3-5 goals total. You can always add more.

### 2. Be Specific

❌ "Get healthy"
✓ "Exercise 3 times per week for 30 minutes"

### 3. Set Realistic Deadlines

Give yourself enough time. It's better to finish early than to constantly miss deadlines.

### 4. Break It Down

Any goal that feels overwhelming needs more milestones.

### 5. Review Weekly

Set aside 15 minutes weekly to:
- Check off completed milestones
- Update goal statuses
- Adjust priorities
- Add new goals

### 6. Celebrate Progress

Don't wait until the goal is 100% complete. Celebrate milestone completions!
